# Talisker: Developer Tools
## Build scripts

This directory contains scripts which are intended to be bundled with source
projects (typically as a git submodule), and used by the project's build
machinery. A `.gitignore` is included which excludes the common Autotools
scripts (`config.guess`, `install-sh`, `missing`, etc.)
